# The tool for the job

I was briefly inconvenienced today because I forgot the name of a particular utility that I needed to reinstall, for dumb software reasons. I actually use the tool daily but seldom interact with it directly and found myself unable to recall what it was called. So, I thought maybe I'd start writing a list of things like this: those utilities that kinda-sorta sit on the margin and hopefully make my days easier. Maybe next time I forget one, I can come look it up here.

## The list

I'll think about categories if it ever gets long enough.

- **[Atuin](https://atuin.sh/)**: searchable shell history with optional sync, includes self-hosted options
- **[Exa](https://the.exa.website/)**: `ls` replacement
- **[AltSnap](https://github.com/RamonUnch/AltSnap)**: moving windows around in Windows with the mouse
- **[bottom](https://github.com/kz6fittycent/bottom)**: process/system monitor for the terminal
- **[gitui](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui)**: git terminal UI
- **[lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)**: simple terminal file manager
